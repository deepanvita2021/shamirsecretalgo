How It Works
JSON Input:

The program reads JSON data containing points for a polynomial.
Each point has an x-value and a y-value encoded in a specific base (like decimal, binary, hexadecimal).
Decode Values:

The program decodes y-values from their encoded base into decimal integers.
Lagrange Interpolation:

It uses Lagrange Interpolation to compute the constant term of the polynomial (the value of the polynomial at x = 0).
Process Test Cases:

The program processes two sets of test data and prints the results.
